# Data Pricing Plans

Pricing is the process whereby a business sets the price at which it will sell its products and services. Pricing **OBJECT** consists of mandatory and optional attributes. This element contains pricing plans related data to be used for example in displaying the items in a marketplace. If needed the standard metadata is converted to marketplace internal format. We encourage all data product owners to enforce usage of this standard.  

Mandatory attributes are listed in separate table and marked with **bolded names** and asterix **\***. Next to the mandatory attributes is an example. 

The same logic applies to the optional attributes as well. Optional attributes are listed in own table and an example is given in the right column. 

Supported pricing models include:

1. recurring time period based (day, week, month, year) plans
2. one time payments plans
3. pay-as-you-go plans
4. revenue sharing plans
5. data volume plan
6. dynamic pricing (high and low limits for automated pricing)
7. Pay what you want plans
8. Freemium
9. Open data

| <div style="width:150px">Element name</div>   | Type  | Options  | Description  |
|---|---|---|---|
| **en** | element | [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) defined 2-letter codes | **REQUIRED** - **NOTE! This is a dynamic element!** This element binds together other product pricing plan attributes and expresses the langugage used. In the example this is "en", which indicates that pricing plan details are in English. If you would like to use French details, then name the element "fr". The naming of this element follows options (language codes) listed in [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) standard. <br/><br/> You can have product pricing plan details in multiple languages simply by adding similar sets like the example - just change the binding element name to matching language code. <br/><br/> The pattern to implement multilanguage support for data products was adopted from de facto UI translation practices. The attributes inside this element are commonly rendered in the UI for the consumer and providing a simple way to implement that was the driving reasoning. See for example  [JSON - Multi Language](https://simplelocalize.io/docs/file-formats/multi-language-json/) |
| **priceCurrency** | string  |  Use standard formats: [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency format e.g. "USD"; Ticker symbol for cryptocurrencies e.g. "BTC"  | **REQUIRED** The primary currency used in pricing. Platforms are assumed to use this as primary currency if currency conversions are used to display product pricing in different locations for various currencies. If the *unit* is revenue-sharing, then this attribute value MUST be percentage.  |
| **price** | string  | -  | **REQUIRED** The offer price of a product, or of a price component, or revenue-sharing percentage. <br/><br/> If the *unit* of pricing is revenue-sharing, then this *price* attribute value is percentage value. <br/><br/> Use '.' (Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator. Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similiar Unicode symbols. <br/><br/>With *data-volume* the price is for each 1GB of data. |
| **billingDuration** | string  | options: instant, day, week, month, year  | **REQUIRED** Specifies for how long this price (or price component) will be billed. Can be used, for example, to model the contractual duration of a subscription or payment plan. |
| **unit** | string | One of: one-time-payment, pay-per-use, recurring, revenue-sharing, data-volume , pay-what-you-want, freemium | **REQUIRED** One-time-payment is for single time purchase purposes, further purchaces are not intended to continue under same agreement. <br/><br/> *Pay-per-use* is intended for continuous usage and price set is for each successful usage action. <br/><br/> *Recurrring* is intended for continuous time period plans. <br/><br/>*Revenue sharing* is a performance-based income model. An effective revenue sharing deal structure is offering your expertise to a business owner to help them grow their business. In return, you get paid a percentage of the revenue as a royalty fee. <br/><br/> *Freemium* is for free access. Use this option also for open data. <br/><br/> *Data-volume* is for data amount based pricing in which customer pays based on the served data amount. The price is always for 1GB of data. <br/><br/> *pay-what-you-want*  is a pricing system where buyers pay any desired amount for a given commodity, sometimes including zero. In some cases, a minimum (floor) price may be set, and/or a suggested price may be indicated as guidance for the buyer. The buyer can also select an amount higher than the standard price for the commodity. If the floor price is set, use *minPrice* attribute. <br/><br/> *open-data*  is an explicit pricing plan category for open data.|
| **maxTransactionQuantity** | Integer |  Integer | **REQUIRED** The maximum transaction quantity for the given billing duration. Use this to define for example monthly (or any other period) request limit to the data product. Note! If you want to set unlimited use, value must be 0 (zero). |
| **offering**  | string | array | **REQUIRED** The element that contains pricing plan content as array of strings. Think of this as the list of what is included in the pricing plan and what you offer in return to the price asked. Use the language defined in the *plan*|
